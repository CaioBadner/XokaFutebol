A Championship Manager type game under development using C# and JSON

This is a very ambitious project that I started a while ago in order to familiarize myself with C# and the Windows Forms framework and it is basically 
a timeless Championship Manager type game where you load whatever database and play whatever season you want. The main difference from this game to the rest is that 
here I don't intend on having players attributes at all, instead I want to rely heavily on players' history and have the game decide what happens each game based on 
what the players and teams have done in the past (up to the point of the game) and also keeping the game as random as football actually is in real life.

The idea is to make a complete game to simulate football matches and also the basic day to day of the football world.
There is already a lot done, but it hardly scratches the surface of what this project is supposed to entail. 

The JSON files will be used as the basic database for players, teams and any other data that the game will store. The idea is that, the more information about players' history 
is available, the more precise the simulation will be. So in the future, I hope to have a community of players helping our database become as comprehensive as possible.

It stands as of right now, a dream. But you can be a part of it, if you want :)
